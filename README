# Clueso.ai Inspired AI Assistant 🚀  
### Assignment Submission – Full Stack Application

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Clueso.ai–inspired AI assistant**, built as part of an assignment.
While inspired by Clueso.ai’s concept, this implementation introduces
custom UI enhancements and interaction flow to make the experience more
engaging and intuitive.

The application demonstrates a complete **end-to-end user flow** —
from entering a prompt to receiving an AI-style response — using a
full-stack architecture.

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - New users can register using the registration form
   - Existing users can log in using valid credentials
   - On successful login, a JWT token is generated

2. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   - JWT token is securely stored on the client side
   - Protected routes are accessible only to authenticated users
   - Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page

3. **Home Dashboard**
   - After authentication, the user is redirected to the Home page
   - The dashboard displays all submitted feedback
   - If no feedback exists, a clear message is shown: *“No feedback available”*

4. **Feedback Management**
   - Feedback is displayed in a card-based layout
   - Each feedback item includes:
     - Feedback content
     - Category (Bug / Improvement / Other)
     - Priority (High / Normal)
     - Created timestamp
   - Users can:
     - Edit feedback
     - Delete feedback
     - Update category and priority

5. **Automatic Priority Assignment**
   - Priority is intelligently assigned while submitting feedback
   - Based on the feedback content, priority is set as **High** or **Normal**

6. **Analytics & Visualization**
   - Category graph shows:
     - Number of Bugs
     - Improvements
     - Other feedback
   - Timeline graph displays:
     - Feedback count added over time
     - Priority distribution across time

7. **Real-Time UI Updates**
   - Dashboard updates immediately after feedback is added, edited, or deleted
   - Ensures smooth and consistent user experience

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend (React.js)**
  - Handles UI rendering and user interactions
  - Manages authentication state and protected routes
  - Displays feedback cards, graphs, and dashboard analytics

- **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**
  - Manages user authentication using JWT
  - Handles CRUD operations for feedback
  - Applies logic for feedback categorization and priority assignment
  - Exposes REST APIs consumed by the frontend

- **Security**
  - JWT-based authentication for all protected routes
  - Token validation on every authorized request

## ✨ Key Features

- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- Protected dashboard access
- Feedback creation, editing, and deletion
- Automatic priority assignment (High / Normal)
- Feedback categorization (Bug, Improvement, Other)
- Card-based feedback display
- Analytics dashboard with:
  - Category-based graphs
  - Timeline-based feedback visualization
- Clean, responsive, and intuitive UI
